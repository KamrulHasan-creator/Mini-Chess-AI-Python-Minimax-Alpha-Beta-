# Mini Chess AI — Python (Minimax + Alpha-Beta)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** based Chess game where:
- You play as **White**.
- The AI plays as **Black**.
- The AI uses **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning**.
- Evaluation function is based on **piece values** (Pawn=100, Knight=320, Bishop=330, Rook=500, Queen=900, King=20000).

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement a playable Chess game in Python.
- Use **Minimax** algorithm with depth-limited search.
- Optimize search with **Alpha-Beta pruning**.
- Provide a simple AI opponent.
